	<p class="story">Many authors have used the term “computer ethics” to describe the field that examines moral issues pertaining to computing and information technology (see, for example, Barger 2008; Johnson 2010). Others use the expression “information ethics” (e.g., Capurro 2007) to refer to a cluster of ethical concerns regarding the flow of information that is either enhanced or restricted by computer technology.4 Because of concerns about ethical issues involving the Internet in particular, some have also used the term “Internet ethics” (Langford 2000). Ethical issues examined in this textbook, however, are not limited to the Internet; they also include privately owned computer networks and interconnected communication technologies—i.e., technologies that we refer to collect- ively as cybertechnology. Hence, we use “cyberethics” to capture the wide range of moral issues involving cybertechnology.
	For our purposes, “cyberethics” is more accurate than “computer ethics” for two reasons. First, the term “computer ethics” can connote ethical issues associated with computing machines, and thus could be construed as pertaining to stand-alone or “unconnected computers.” Because computing technologies and communication tech- nologies have converged in recent years, resulting in networked systems, a computer system may now be thought of more accurately as a new kind of medium than as a machine. Second, the term “computer ethics” might also suggest a field of study that is concerned exclusively with ethical issues affecting computer professionals. Although these issues are very important, and are examined in detail in Chapter 4 as well as in relevant sections of Chapters 6 and 12, we should note that the field of cyberethics is not limited to an analysis of moral issues that affect only professionals.
	“Cyberethics” is also more accurate, for our purposes, than “information ethics.” For one thing, “information ethics” is ambiguous because it can mean a specific methodo- logical framework—i.e., Information Ethics (or IE)—for analyzing issues in cyberethics (Floridi 2007).5 Or it can connote a cluster of ethical issues of particular interest to professionals in the fields of library science and information science (Buchanan and Henderson 2009). In the latter sense, “information ethics” refers to ethical concerns affecting the free flow of, and unfettered access to, information, which include issues such as library censorship and intellectual freedom. (These issues are examined in Chapter 9.) Our analysis of cyberethics issues in this text, however, is not limited to controversies often considered under the heading “information ethics.”
	Given the wide range of moral issues examined in this book, the term “cyberethics” is also more comprehensive, and more appropriate, than “Internet ethics.” Although many of the issues considered under the heading cyberethics often pertain to the Internet, some issues examined in this textbook do not involve the Internet per se—for example, issues associated with computerized monitoring in the workplace, with professional responsi- bility for designing reliable computer hardware and software systems, and with the implications of cybertechnology for gender and race. We examine ethical issues that cut across the spectrum of devices and networked communication systems comprising cybertechnology, from stand-alone computers to networked systems.
	Finally, we should note that some issues in the emerging fields of “agent ethics,” “bot ethics,” “robo-ethics,” or what Wallach and Allen (2009) call “machine ethics,” overlap with a cluster of concerns examined under the heading of cyberethics. Wallach and Allen define machine ethics as a field that expands upon traditional computer ethics because it</p>
